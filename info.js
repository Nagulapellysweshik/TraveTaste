        content: `<p><b>Posted:</b> 7/28/2023 | July 28th, 2023</p>
            <p>I first visited France in 2006. Back then, the hostels weren’t that great. There were just a few that were good (one is actually still around and is still my favorite). Now, there’s a lot of hostel options in France, ranging from bare-bones cheap hostels to digital nomad hubs.</p>
            <p>France is a really compact and easily walkable city. Nothing is too far from anything else so regardless of where you’ll stay, you’ll be able to walk around. (And most of the hostels are clustered together anyway.)</p>
            <p>While you can always use the reviews on booking websites, I’ve compiled my list of favorites based on over fifteen years of personal visits and taking groups to the city.</p>
            <p>Ostello Bello Firenze is right in the center of town. The staff is really nice, they have a beautiful common room, bar, and a kitchen for you to cook in. All the guests get a free welcome drink too. There’s also a rooftop terrace and they organize a ton of activities throughout the week. It’s a really good hostel to meet people in. </p>
            <p>Le Village Montmartre is a cozy hostel located in the artistic neighborhood of Montmartre. It’s perfect for travelers who want to explore the artistic and bohemian side of Paris. The hostel offers comfortable beds, a communal kitchen, and a lively bar where you can mingle with fellow travelers. Plus, it's just a short walk from the famous Sacré-Cœur Basilica.</p>
            <p>St. Christopher's Inn Paris is part of a popular hostel chain known for its vibrant atmosphere and social events. The Paris branch is no exception, offering spacious dorms, a lively bar, and a restaurant serving delicious French cuisine. The hostel organizes daily walking tours and pub crawls, making it easy for solo travelers to meet new people and explore the city together.</p>
            <p>Les Piaules is a stylish hostel located in the trendy neighborhood of Belleville. The hostel features modern design, comfortable beds, and stunning views of the city from its rooftop terrace. Guests can enjoy the on-site bar, communal areas, and regular events such as movie nights and live music performances. The location is ideal for discovering local cafes, art galleries, and hidden gems in Paris.</p>
            <p>While France has a lot of hostel options, I think the four above are the best. They have the nicest accommodations, are very central, have great vibes, and welcoming staff. Plus, they all have decent beds. And that’s important! Book one of the hostels above and enjoy your time in France. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
